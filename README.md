# flashcard-app
## Overview
In this program I aim to create a flashcard program that uses my knowledge on different aspects using Python. I see it as a quasi-capsstone project for everything that I have learned so far.

It is an Icelandic-English flashcard program that lets the user learn the 1000 most used words in the Icelandic language (according to Open Subtitles, as obtained from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Icelandic_wordlist).
